# Reading Files

* **Objective** - To create a webpage that will upload a file and print the file-content to the `console` window.
* **Purpose** - To establish familiarity javascript's file-reader object.
* **Description**
    * You are provided with a file located at `./assets/js/read-files.js`
    * Edit the file by defining the respective function-stub.



## Part 1 - Clone the project

* Begin by _forking_ this project into a personal repository.
   * To do this, click the `Fork` button located at the top right of this page.
* Navigate to your github profile to find the _newly forked repository_.
* Clone the repository from **your account** into the `~/dev` directory.
* Open the newly cloned project in a code editor (Visual Studio Code, for example).




## Part 2 - Modifying `read-files.js`
* Upon cloning the project, from a **browser**, open the `./index.html` located at the root of the project.
* Upon uploading a file via the `input` web-element, the inspector tools should reveal `log` messages from `console` displaying the respective filecontent.
    * Upload `./assets/file-to-upload.txt` as a way of testing your application.
* Modify `./assets/js/read-files.js` to ensure that the output selecting a given file is the text-content of the file displayed in `console`.
* Below is an image of expected output, given the input is `./assets/file-to-upload.txt`
